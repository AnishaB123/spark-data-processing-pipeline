# Spark Data Processing Pipeline

A distributed data processing pipeline built using Apache Spark to handle large-scale data transformation and analytics.

## 🚀 Features
- Distributed batch data processing
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Aggregations and analytical computations
- Scalable Spark job execution

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Python
- Hadoop (HDFS compatible)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The pipeline follows a distributed batch-processing architecture:

- Data is ingested from source files (CSV / JSON / Parquet)
- Apache Spark processes data in parallel across partitions
- Transformations and aggregations are applied using Spark DataFrames
- Final processed data is written to storage for analytics and reporting

This design ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient large-scale processing.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Load raw datasets into Spark DataFrames  
2. Perform data cleaning (null handling, filtering, schema validation)  
3. Apply transformations and aggregations  
4. Execute Spark jobs in a distributed manner  
5. Store processed output for downstream analytics
